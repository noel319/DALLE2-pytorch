## DALL-E 2 - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>, OpenAI's updated text-to-image synthesis neural network, in Pytorch. <a href="https://youtu.be/RJwPN4qNi_Y?t=555">Yannic Kilcher summary</a>

The main novelty seems to be an extra layer of indirection with the prior network (whether it is an autoregressive transformer or a diffusion network), which predicts an image embedding based on the text embedding from CLIP. Specifically, this repository will only build out the diffusion prior network, as it is the best performing variant (but which incidentally involves a causal transformer as the denoising network ðŸ˜‚)

This model is SOTA for text-to-image for now.

It may also explore an extension of using <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/latentdiffusion">latent diffusion</a> in the decoder from Rombach et al.

Do let me know if anyone is interested in a Jax version https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE2-pytorch/discussions/8

## Install

```bash
$ pip install dalle2-pytorch
```

## Usage (work in progress)

<a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep">template</a>

```bash
$ dream 'sharing a sunset at the summit of mount everest with my dog'
```

Once built, images will be saved to the same directory the command is invoked

## Training (work in progress, will offer both in code and as command-line)
