## DALL-E 2 - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>, OpenAI's updated text-to-image synthesis neural network, in Pytorch

This is SOTA for text-to-image now, but probably not for long.

It may also explore an extension of using latent diffusion in the decoder
